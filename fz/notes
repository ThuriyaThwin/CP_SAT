TODO list:

1-handling constraints with constants
2-the output[] doesn't work with mzn files. e.g. 
 
int: nc = 3;
var 1..nc: wa;
constraint wa != 2;
solve satisfy;
output ["wa=", show(wa), "\n"];

3- How to verify OPTIMAL solutions?

4- Encoding variables like :
 variable {1,4,6} x;

5-set_in and set_le bugs
